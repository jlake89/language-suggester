    <h1>C#</h1>

    <h2>C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000.</h2>
<p>Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET. As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0, which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0. Source: Wikipedia</p>

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
<h2>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.</h2>
    <p>t was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8. Source: W3Schools</p>

    <h1>Python</h1>
<h2>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects. Source: Wikipedia</p>
